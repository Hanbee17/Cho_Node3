# Game Project

Game Title: **Smoking Gun**

Basic Format: Mystery Investigation Game

Basic concept: The user will be a detective finding the murderer among the suspects

Format + Concept: Clues and pieces of evidence will be presented on the main screen to guess the murderer.

Visual Style: Illustrative and cartoon-like drawing of the crime scene

Software: p5.js

**Overview:**
This project is based on my ongoing interest in various crime scenes and the profiling process of detectives. The goal of this game is to create a mystery crime scene based on a true story. In the game, players will firstly see the home screen with mysterious mood background with a start button and the sound button. Clicking the “Start” button will let the player see the trigger warning sign and the brief instruction and the short story about the case will be given before entering the home screen. The main screen will be a one-square-room illustration with hidden clues that can be found by clicking the suspicious parts or characters on the screen. Clues, suspects, and reports will be added on the sides by the player clicking the right section. Founding all pieces of evidence and smoking gun evidence will let the player guess the suspect and the smoking gun piece (the strongest evidence). The end screen will let the player pick the murderer and the smoking gun and the “Congratulation” sign will pop up with a brief story about the crime, a “Go back” button, and an artist statement link. If the player got the wrong answer, they will be given an unlimited chance to guess after seeing the “Wrong!” sign and clicking the “X” button to remove the pop-up screen.
